# HTTP, HTTPS, Virtualization, Network, Sockets and Socket Programming

### Day 1 HTTP continued from period-1 
Headers, Caching, HTTP Sessions and how they are implemented, Cookies and CORS

### Day 2 Fundamental Network Topics
The TCP/IP stack, DNS, Routers, DHCP, Load Balancing, Virtualization

### Day 3 Sockets and Socket Programming
Sockets Ports and IP-numbers. Socket Programming (TCP and UDP)

### Day 4 Final Digital Ocean setup for this semester
SSL and HTTPS intro. How to set up DO with a domanin name, Nginx and SSL

### Day 5 - Study point exercises

## Learning objectives
- Understand and use properties in the HTTP protocol, like Headers, Caching, HTTP Sessions and Cookies
- Understand the Same Origin Policy related to REST and how to solve problems using CORS
- Understand, at a conceptual level, the concepts in the underlying structure of the internet
- Understand the Concepts Ports and IP and the Protocols TCP and UDP.
- Know how to implement simple, multi-threaded, TCP (UDP) servers in Java
- Understand the concept Virtualization 
- Understand and Implement modern Server Architectures 
- Understand and use concepts required to setup a Server with a domain name, Reverse Proxy and SSL

## Business competences
This week will provide students with:
- The necessary background to implement and code user defined network protocols on top of TCP or UDP.
- The minimal network knowledge, required to setup a Web Server Infrastructure used by a professional web-application

## Resources: 
### Day-1
Read/Skim the first 16 pages in the first document below (by know it should be familar stuff)

Skim the rest of the articles as backgrund for the individual HTTP exercises
- [HTTP](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_tutorial.pdf)
- [Same Origine Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)
- [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- [Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) 
### Day-2
Read the first article to get an idea about the TCP/IP Protocol Stack (a complete understanding of this stack could take a full period)
- [TCP/IP Protocol Fundamentals Explained with a Diagram](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/11/tcp-ip-fundamentals)
- [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)

These are practiacal tools which you should know about (what can each of them can do). We don't provide references, but use Google (before and during) the lesson:
- nslookup
- ipconfig   (MAC/Linux     ifconfig)
- Ping
- Netstat
- TraceRoute (Windows tracert)
- Telnet

### Day-3
[Socket Progamming in Java (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YoKVswJsKI) If you like a Visual Presentaion of a problem, you should really watch this video before todays lecture
[All About Sockets](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/index.html) (Oracle Tutorial)
[A guide to Java Sockets](http://www.baeldung.com/a-guide-to-java-sockets) (Read, Code and understand this example, and you will know what you need to know for CA-2)
