### Day 5 - Study point exercises

## Learning objectives
- Understand and use properties in the HTTP protocol, like Headers, Caching, HTTP Sessions and Cookies
- Understand the Same Origin Policy related to REST and how to solve problems using CORS
- Understand, at a conceptual level, the concepts in the underlying structure of the internet
- Understand the Concepts Ports and IP and the Protocols TCP and UDP.

- Understand the concept Virtualization 
- Understand and Implement modern Server Architectures 
- Understand and use concepts required to setup a Server with a domain name, Reverse Proxy and SSL

## Business competences
This week will provide students with:
- The necessary background to implement and code user defined network protocols on top of TCP or UDP.
- The minimal network knowledge, required to setup a Web Server Infrastructure used by a professional web-application

## Resources: 
### Day-1
Read/Skim the first 16 pages in the first document below (by know it should be familar stuff)

Skim the rest of the articles as backgrund for the individual HTTP exercises
- [HTTP](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_tutorial.pdf)
- [Same Origine Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)
- [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- [Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) 
### Day-2
Read the first article to get an idea about the TCP/IP Protocol Stack (a complete understanding of this stack could take a full period)
- [TCP/IP Protocol Fundamentals Explained with a Diagram](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/11/tcp-ip-fundamentals)
- [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)

These are practiacal tools which you should know about (what can each of the do). We don't provide references, but use Google (before and during) the lesson:
- nslookup
- ipconfig   (MAC/Linux     ifconfig)
- Ping
- Netstat
- TraceRoute (Windows tracert)
- Telnet
